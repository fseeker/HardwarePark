# Welcome to Hardware Park

Hardware Park is one of my first pet project to learn Angular. It contains many pwerful angular features like authGuard, Lazy Loading, animation etc.

To run Hardware Park, Simply download the project, navigate to download folder, open cmd, and run "npm update" to install dependencies, then "ng serve" to run the project. You can view the project in Localhost:4200/.

Special thanks to Deborah Kuratah for guiding me through this learning process.
